# 📊 Financial Dataset Analysis with Python 🐼


###This repository contains my capstone project for analyzing financial datasets using Python. The project incorporates key financial concepts such as alpha & beta analysis, portfolio construction, and Sharpe ratio calculation. The analysis and visualizations were implemented using Pandas and Matplotlib.

🔍 Project Overview
The project focuses on building an equal-weight portfolio of assets and evaluating its performance through statistical metrics like alpha and beta. The steps include:

Importing and cleaning financial data.
Performing time-series analysis with Pandas.
Visualizing trends using Matplotlib.
Computing portfolio returns and risk metrics.
Evaluating performance using the Sharpe ratio.
🚀 Features
Alpha and Beta Analysis: Evaluate asset sensitivity to market changes and calculate excess return.
Equal-Weight Portfolio Construction: Combine assets into a portfolio with equal weight distribution.
Performance Metrics: Sharpe ratio computation to assess risk-adjusted returns.
Data Visualization: Trend analysis using time-series plots and histograms.
🛠️ Tools Used
Python Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib for creating financial plots.
Key Metrics:
Alpha & Beta
